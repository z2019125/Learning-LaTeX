# ECON 691: Learning LaTeX on GitHub

Welcome to our two-week module on LaTeX. This module will be highly integrated with GitHub using the <a href="https://github.com/sanjib-sen/weblatex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WebLaTex project</a>. The notes and activities are based off of Dr. John D. Lees-Miller <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"An Interactive Introduction to LaTeX"</a> for Overleaf, which is an online LaTeX compiler.

## Introduction

LaTeX is a typesetting system that uses code to produce high-quality scientific/mathematical documents. LaTeX is available for free and is increasing in integration with other software systems (including learning management systems, like Blackboard, and project databases, like GitHub). LaTeX is easy to learn the basics of and will help your writing and math look professional and match the industry standard. In this section of the 691 course, we will go over some basics of LaTeX, start making documents, and prepare you to integrate it into your other classes at NIU.
